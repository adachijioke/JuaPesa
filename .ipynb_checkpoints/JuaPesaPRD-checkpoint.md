# Jua Pesa — PRD (AI Liquidity Network)

## 1. Vision / elevator pitch

Enable near-instant, low-cost, compliant cross-wallet transfers across African mobile money rails by routing liquidity through a regulated stablecoin network and AI-driven liquidity router. Users dial a simple USSD short code (e.g. `*789#`) to convert between local mobile money, tokenized local currency (e.g., cNGN), international stablecoins (USDC), and commodity-backed tokens (XAUt) — with automated, capital-efficient rebalancing across pools. This dramatically reduces failed interoperability fees and speeds transfers to seconds.

## 2. Goals & success metrics

**Business goals**

* Reduce cross-rail settlement failures and fees for users and merchants.
* Enable sub-\$0.10 interoperability transfers and <15s effective UX for core paths.
* Achieve compliant pilot in one country (e.g., Kenya or Nigeria) within 6 months, with 10k monthly active users (MAU) by pilot end.

**KPIs**

* End-to-end transfer latency (target: <15s for most flows).
* Failed transfer rate (target: <0.5%).
* Liquidity slippage / routing cost per transfer (target: <\$0.05 on typical value).
* Regulatory/compliance passes (sandbox approval, AML/SAN checks).
* MAU and volume: pilot target 100k transactions / month.

---

## 3. Why now / evidence

* Mobile money is huge in Africa — recent GSMA reporting shows mobile money account growth and \~\$1.4T+ annual transaction value (mobile money is integral across Sub-Saharan Africa). ([GSMA][1])
* Local regulated stablecoins (e.g., cNGN) and tokenized assets (e.g., XAUt) are emerging as rails suitable for fast settlement and custody-backed value. Nigeria’s cNGN and related approvals were publicized in 2024. ([cngn.co][2], [Forbes][3])
* Circle’s CCTP provides a secure, native burn/mint cross-chain mechanism for USDC enabling fast cross-chain liquidity unification (CCTP V2 includes “Fast Transfer” and Hooks). ([developers.circle.com][4], [Circle][5])
* Hedera is a low-fee, sustainability-minded DLT that supports token services and EVM compatibility — attractive for high volume, low-fee micropayments. ([Hedera][6])

**Estimated macro impact (illustrative)**
GSMA shows \~\$1.4T in mobile money transaction value for recent year(s). If we conservatively estimate 0.03% in inefficiency/fees saved via better interoperability, the savings ≈ \$420M/year (0.0003 × \$1,400,000,000,000 = \$420,000,000). (Used here as a modeling/impact example — replace with country/pilot-specific numbers for a business case). ([GSMA][7])

---

## 4. Target users & stakeholders

* End users: individuals on feature phones & smartphones using mobile money (M-Pesa, MTN MobileMoney, Airtel Money, etc.).
* Merchants: local merchants suffering failed transfers / high settlement times.
* Banks / fintechs: partners offering on/off ramps, custody.
* Telcos: provide USSD & integration (essential partner).
* Regulators: central banks and AML authorities (must be engaged early).
* Liquidity providers (LPs): banks/market makers providing stablecoin reserves.

---

## 5. Product scope (MVP vs Phase 2)

**MVP (Pilot, single country)**

* USSD front-end: simple flows for “Send”, “Receive”, “Convert”.
* Wallet back-end: custodial wallet per user (KYC/mini-KYC), mapping to mobile number.
* On-ramp/off-ramp: direct debits/credits to mobile money via telco APIs (M-Pesa / local APIs). ([Safaricom][8])
* Stablecoin core: mint/burn and pool orchestration for a small set of tokens — cNGN (local), USDC (via CCTP), XAUt (optional).
* AI Liquidity Router: time-series forecast + rule-based rebalancer that predicts cash-in/out per operator and rebalances pools to minimize conversion cost.
* Settlement engine using Hedera (HTS or Hedera EVM) for ledgering and Circle CCTP for cross-chain USDC movement. ([developers.circle.com][4], [Hedera][9])

**Phase 2 (scale)**

* Add more rails and chains (other local stablecoins, additional CCTP-supported chains).
* Faster transfer modes (use CCTP V2 Fast Transfer/Hooks). ([Circle][5])
* Non-custodial wallet support, merchant APIs and plugins.
* Liquidity marketplace for LPs with dynamic fees and SLAs.
* Cross-border remittance corridors (Nigeria ↔ Kenya, etc.)

## 6. Functional requirements (top level)

1. **USSD flow**: `*789#` → authenticate → choose Send/Receive/Convert → amount → destination → confirm → txn. Sessions survive network hiccups; PIN or OTP for security; multi-language support.
2. **Wallet & user mapping**: phone number ↔ custodial wallet; KYC stored off-chain; on-chain IDs stored hashed.
3. **On-ramp/off-ramp**: integrate with telco/operator APIs for debit/credit. Reconciliation & idempotency.
4. **Stablecoin pools**: tokenized local and international pools with mint/burn hooks.
5. **AI Router**: continuous forecasting of agent-level cash demand, suggests or triggers pool rebalancing when thresholds breached.
6. **Settlement & bridge**: use Hedera for token issuance + Circle CCTP for USDC cross-chain transfers.
7. **Compliance & AML**: transaction monitoring, sanctions checks, thresholds for mandatory KYC escalation.
8. **Monitoring & alerts**: SLO based alerts for liquidity shortfalls, failed transfers, attestation delays.

---

## 7. Non-functional requirements

* Latency: typical USSD → final settlement confirmed in <15s for most flows (fast mode); worst-case fallback under 5 minutes.
* Availability: 99.95% regional availability.
* Security: HSM for private keys, SOC2 practices, end-to-end audit trail, on-chain attestations for all mint/burn events.
* Privacy: store minimal PII on-chain (hashed references); comply with local data residency laws.
* Cost: per-txn cost target <\$0.10 (including telco fees, on-chain fees, and routing margin).

---

## 8. High-level architecture (components & data flow)

1. **USSD Gateway (Telco Integration)**

   * Telco/USSD provider → USSD Gateway (session manager) → Backend API.
   * Use telco’s Daraja / M-Pesa style APIs for C2B/B2C flows. ([Safaricom][8])

2. **Backend Microservices**

   * Auth & KYC service (connects to KYC provider).
   * Wallet service (custodial ledger, user balances off-chain).
   * Liquidity & Pool Manager (tracks pool balances, issues rebalances).
   * Router (AI + rules) — forecasts operator cash flows, creates rebalance orders.
   * Settlement Engine — interacts with Hedera Token Service (HTS) / Hedera EVM and with Circle CCTP endpoints for USDC cross-chain flows. ([developers.circle.com][4], [Hedera][9])

3. **Blockchain layer**

   * Hedera: token issuance, HTS transfers, final settlement ledger. (Use HBAR for fees.) ([Hedera][6])
   * Cross-chain: USDC movements via Circle CCTP (burn on source chain, mint on destination). ([developers.circle.com][4])

4. **AI/ML stack**

   * Data ingestion (telco / operator transaction logs, historical settlement times).
   * Forecast model (Time-series model + RL rebalancer). Suggestions below.
   * Explanation layer (LLM for natural language explanations / operator alerts, if desired).

5. **Monitoring / Ops**

   * On-chain watchers, Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, on-call rotation.

---

## 9. AI design — forecasting & routing

**Clarification on model choice**

* Mistral 7B is a high-quality LLM with finetuning support (good for orchestration, explanation, decision support). For pure numeric time-series forecasting, use specialized models (Temporal Fusion Transformer, N-BEATS, LSTM, or Prophet) for high accuracy; then use an LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B fine-tuned) for producing human-readable summaries, automated incident messages, or decision-making prompts. Mistral supports fine-tuning and Mistral provides guides and tooling for fine-tuning. ([Mistral AI][10], [Mistral AI Documentation][11])

**Recommended approach (practical & hybrid)**

1. **Data pipeline**: collect per-operator, per-agent, per-region daily & intra-day cash-in/out volumes; enrich with calendar, macroeconomic signals, holiday schedules, merchant wage cycles. (Store in time-series DB like ClickHouse/TimescaleDB.)
2. **Forecasting model (primary)**: use a TF-based or TFT / N-BEATS architecture to produce 1h/4h/24h predictions for expected net cash demand per operator. Evaluate with MAE/RMSE.
3. **Rebalancer (control)**: policy or constrained RL that decides how much to move between stablecoin pools considering fees, slippage, and on-chain finality. Keep a rule-based safety floor.
4. **Orchestration & human-explainability**: Use Mistral-7B (fine-tuned) to turn model outputs into explanations (“Operator X predicted -₦50M cash out next 4h because of payroll cycles — suggest 30% top-up from pool Y”), for compliance reports, for fraud detection flagging, and for human operator chat/alerts. ([Mistral AI Documentation][11], [Mistral AI][10])

**Model fine-tuning steps (practical)**

* Collect 6–12 months of historical transactions (minute/hour granularity) with labels: operator, region, net flow, fees, settlement time. (Anonymize PII.)
* Data cleaning & feature engineering (lags, rolling windows, holiday flags).
* Train baseline models: ETS/Prophet; LSTM; TFT. Evaluate and select the best for forecasting horizons.
* Build rebalancer logic (cost model) and simulate with historical data.
* Fine-tune LLM (Mistral) on operator logs + human annotations for explainability tasks (use LoRA/QLoRA/PEFT to reduce compute). Mistral docs and tooling are available. ([GitHub][12], [DigitalOcean][13])
* Deploy forecasting models behind an inference API (gRPC/REST), autoscale with vLLM or similar.

## 10. Step-by-step technical implementation plan (detailed)

### Phase 0 — Prepare & compliance

1. Engage regulator & telco(s) — secure sandbox / API access (e.g., M-Pesa Daraja). ([Safaricom][8])
2. Form partnerships: local banks / custodians, a Circle contact for CCTP access, Hedera node or hosted service. ([developers.circle.com][14], [Hedera][9])
3. Legal & AML: define KYC thresholds, AML rules, data residency plan.

### Phase 1 — Core infra & wallet

4. **Infra**: Provision cloud infra (K8s cluster, DBs — Postgres + TimescaleDB/ClickHouse, Redis) and HSM for keys.
5. **USSD Gateway**: Setup USSD provider integration; build session manager and simple prototypes for `*789#` flows. (Use telco sandbox.)
6. **Wallet service**: implement custodial ledger (off-chain balances + on-chain reconciliation).
7. **Telco adapters**: implement connectors (C2B, B2C, STK push / pull) with idempotency and reconciliation.

### Phase 2 — On-chain & stablecoin plumbing 

8. **Hedera tokens**: set up testnet tokens (HTS) for cNGN, XAUt wrappers, and an internal stable pool token. Test mint/burn flows on Hedera testnet. ([Hedera][6])
9. **CCTP integration**: integrate Circle's CCTP on supported chains for USDC flows—build the attestation fetch & mint endpoint workflow. Test with Circle dev docs. ([developers.circle.com][4])
10. **Custody & reserves**: set up bank custody relationship and hot/cold wallets; define LP agreements.

### Phase 3 — AI router + risk controls

11. **Data pipeline**: ingest telco logs and settlement events to Time-Series DB.
12. **Forecast & rebalancer**: build & train forecasting models; backtest rebalancer on historic data.
13. **Decision automation**: implement auto-rebalance triggers with safety thresholds and operator overrides.

### Phase 4 — Pilot & testing 

14. **E2E testing**: sandbox telco → wallet → stablecoin → settlement; run stress tests and settlement reconciliation.
15. **Security & audits**: code audit, penetration testing, financial & smart contract audit.
16. **Pilot rollout**: limited user cohort (e.g., 5k users) in one region; track KPIs & iterate.

### Phase 5 — Scale & multi-rail (Weeks 28+)

17. Expand to additional telcos, add more stablecoin pools (additional c… tokens), optimize routing strategies, add merchant integration and APIs.

---

## 11. Integration & API contract samples (examples)

**USSD → backend (POST)**
`POST /api/ussd/session`
Body: `{ sessionId, phone, input, menuState }`
Response: `{ prompt, nextMenuState, actions: [debit|credit|convert|confirm] }`

**Convert API**
`POST /api/convert`
Body: `{ userId, from: {rail, operator, amount}, to: {token, chain}, mode: 'fast'|'standard' }`
Response: `{ status, txId, estimatedCompletion, fees }`

**Liquidity order**
`POST /api/liquidity/rebalance`
Body: `{ sourcePool, destPool, amount, reason, predictedDemandWindow }`
Response: `{ orderId, status }`

(These are templates — embed security tokens, HMAC signatures, and idempotency keys.)

---

## 12. Security, audit & compliance checklist

* HSM + multi-sig for on-chain keys; segregate hot/cold wallets.
* KYC provider integration and real-time sanctions screening.
* Audit every mint/burn and maintain a public attestations ledger (for transparency).
* Smart contract audits (third party): token contracts, bridge adapters, router contracts.
* Rate limits, transaction throttling, anomaly detection.
* Data protection: encrypt PII at rest, only hashed references on-chain.

---

## 13. Monitoring & observability

* On-chain watchers: track mint/burn events, CCTP attestations, bridge latencies.
* Liquidity dashboard: pool balances, predicted vs actual flows, slippage.
* Alerts: low pool liquidity, failed attestation, telco reversals, suspicious patterns.
* Compliance logs: exportable reports & transaction trail for audits.

---

## 14. Team & roles (initial)

* Product Lead / PM — 1
* Backend Engineers — 2–3
* Blockchain Engineers (Hedera + Bridge) — 2
* ML Engineers / Data Scientist — 2
* Mobile/Telco Integrations Engineer — 1
* DevOps / SRE — 1
* Security / Compliance Officer — 1
* QA / Test Engineer — 1
* Legal & Regulatory consultant — (contract)

---

## 15. Risks & mitigations

* **Regulatory risk**: Engage with central banks early; run in sandbox; keep fiat custodians licensed. Mitigation: limit pilot KYC vs. non-KYC flows, maintain local counsel.
* **Liquidity crunch**: Maintain minimum reserve buffers; dynamic fees to discourage imbalanced flows.
* **Telco dependence / outages**: Multi-telco redundancy where possible; graceful fallback to on-chain receipts and delayed settlement.
* **Bridge risk / attestation delays**: prefer CCTP where possible (burn/mint semantics) to reduce wrapped-token trust surface. ([developers.circle.com][4])
* **Model risk**: conservative rebalancer safety floors and human override.

---

## 16. Estimated budget (ballpark ranges)

* MVP pilot (6–9 months): \$300k – \$650k (engineering, legal, infra, audits, telco integration fees).
* Scale (1–2 years): \$1M+ (market expansion, reserves, compliance & partnerships).
  (Provide a detailed line-item estimate if you want — I can build a spreadsheet.)

---

## 17. Testing & validation plan

* Unit & integration tests for all APIs.
* Simulated telco traffic & bank settlements.
* On-chain simulation (Hedera testnet + Circle dev) for mint/burn/attestation flows. ([Hedera][6], [developers.circle.com][14])
* Stress & chaos testing for liquidity events.
* Pilot A/B: compare transfers through Jua Pesa vs baseline mobile-money rails for latency, cost, and failure rate.

---

## 18. Rollout & commercial plan (pilot → scale)

1. Launch pilot with telco partner + 5k users in 1 city → measure KPIs (4–8 weeks).
2. Onboard banks/LPs for reserves and custody; set LP fees and SLAs.
3. Expand to additional telcos & second city → broaden pool coverage.
4. Merchant integrations + API monetization (per-tx fee, subscription).
5. Broaden cross-border corridors; onboard Circle USDC corridors using CCTP for efficient settlement. ([Circle][5])

---

## 19. Appendix — Developer quickstart checklist (MVP)

1. Register for telco sandbox (Daraja / M-Pesa or local operator). ([Safaricom][8])
2. Create Hedera testnet account & create HTS token sample. ([Hedera][6])
3. Register/dev account with Circle for CCTP test access and read CCTP docs & samples. ([developers.circle.com][14])
4. Build USSD gateway microservice + session store (Redis).
5. Implement wallet service (Postgres + ledger table with off-chain balances).
6. Implement conversion flow → call Hedera mint/burn / Circle CCTP attestation flow.
7. Build data ingestion (telco logs) + small TFT or LSTM forecasting proof-of-concept.
8. Run integration tests and security audit.
